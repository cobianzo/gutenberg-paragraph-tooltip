# Questions for the AI agent to develop this project

1. Help me creating a new project in wordpress, using wp-env (I don't want to install it globally, I want a local dependency of wp-env for development).

> This will give you the commands `npm init`, `npm install wp-env -D`, and the starting data for `plugin.php`. Then add in `package.json` the `"scripts": "up" : "wp-env start"` and you have an instance running (Docker must be running)

2. I want to setup the project for typescript
